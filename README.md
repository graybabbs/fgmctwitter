We provide datasets containing tweet IDs for each of the six years in the dataset. 
Original tweet text and user metadata reported in this study cannot be deposited in a public repository because of Twitter's data sharing policy. 
Tweet IDs can be used to retrieve original tweet data via Twitterâ€™s public application programming interface (API).
